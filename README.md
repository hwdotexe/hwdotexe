I'm a full-time software developer, and I'm passionate about API development, accessible and inclusive UI/UX design, and protecting users through Privacy by Design. When I'm not at work, I'm building fun side projects, playing video games, or enjoying the outdoors.

## Where to Find Me
I'm not available on most social media platforms due to personal preference. However, you can still reach out via GitHub, E-Mail, or by visiting my website at [https://hadenwatne.com/](https://hadenwatne.com/)
